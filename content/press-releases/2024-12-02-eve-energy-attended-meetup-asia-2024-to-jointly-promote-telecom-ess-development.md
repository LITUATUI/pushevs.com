In the context of problems such as difficult deployment, short power supply distances, and susceptibility to theft faced by traditional lead-acid batteries, EVE Energy has launched the EVE-48V-TES100 intelligent lithium battery product, featuring self-developed LFP cells and an intelligent BMS. This product, designed for optimization, supports long-distance power supply and can be connected in parallel with up to 32 battery packs to meet the needs of infrastructure expansion. 

Meanwhile, EVE-48V-TES100 is equipped with a gyroscope and GPS positioning function to realize anti-theft protection. It can be safely utilized with various types of batteries such as lead-acid batteries and used lithium batteries, simplifying battery management in base stations and enabling effective resource utilization.
