he Integration Innovation â€“ The Edge574 Blade Cell demonstrates exceptional adaptability through its optimized design for both cell-to-pack (CTP) and cell-to-body (CTB) integration. 

This design flexibility maximizes space utilization within the vehicle, leading to increased energy density at the pack level and ultimately contributing to greater driving range, all while achieving impressive gravimetric and volumetric densities of 190 Wh/kg and 420 Wh/l at cell level.
