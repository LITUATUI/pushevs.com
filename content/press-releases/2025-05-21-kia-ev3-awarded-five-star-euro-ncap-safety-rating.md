The EV3 was assessed in four categories and performed to a high standard throughout the test process. The vehicle achieved 83% for adult occupant protection, 84% for child occupant protection, 78% for vulnerable road users including pedestrians (77% without DriveWise ADAS pack), and 78% in the ‘safety assist’ category (67% without DriveWise ADAS pack). The DriveWise ADAS Pack* uses a combination of cameras and radars to detect hazardous situations and assist the driver with safe driving and manoeuvring.
