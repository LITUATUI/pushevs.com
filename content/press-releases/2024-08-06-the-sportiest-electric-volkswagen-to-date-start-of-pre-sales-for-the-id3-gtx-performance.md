The energy comes from a 79 kWh lithium-ion battery (net), which absorbs up to 185 kW of power at DC quick-charging stations thanks to innovative charging and thermal management with battery pre-conditioning. The battery can be charged from 10 to 80 per cent again in about 26 minutes. The ID.3 GTX Performanceâ€™s WLTP range is up to 601 km.
