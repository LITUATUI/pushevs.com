The composition of LMR cells is much different – around 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and virtually no cobalt. Here’s why that matters: manganese is cheaper and more plentiful than either nickel or cobalt. The material in these cells is much less expensive. The chemistry also lends itself well to larger cell sizes, which further reduces system cost, with fewer connective and structural elements in a battery pack.
