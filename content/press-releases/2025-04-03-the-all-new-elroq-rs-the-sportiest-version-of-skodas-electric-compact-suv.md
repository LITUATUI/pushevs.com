 Škoda Auto is launching the RS range-topper six months after the world premiere of the all-new Škoda Elroq, which competes in the popular electric compact SUV segment. The latest member of the RS family has two motors generating a total system output of 250 kW and is equipped with all‑wheel drive. The Elroq RS comes with an electric range of more than 550 kilometres on the WLTP cycle, specific RS accessories and comprehensive standard equipment. It is also the fastest accelerating car in Škoda’s current model portfolio, sprinting from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.4 seconds.
