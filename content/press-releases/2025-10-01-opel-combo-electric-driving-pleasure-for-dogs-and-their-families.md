The latest Combo Electric can comfortably accommodate several dogs of different sizes, allowing them to explore new territory together with their favourite humans. Combo drivers and passengers can travel up to 344 kilometres (according to WLTP3) locally emissions-free without having to stop to recharge. And the 50 kWh battery can be recharged to 80 per cent capacity at a 100 kW DC fast charging station in just under 30 minutes â€“ enough time for everyone and every dog to stretch their legs.
