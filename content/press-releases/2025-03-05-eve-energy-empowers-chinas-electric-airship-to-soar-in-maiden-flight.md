As the first electric manned airship in China, AS700D has been fully upgraded for electrification based on traditional fuel airships. EVE Energy's lithium-ion battery system supports discharging at a maximum of 8C pulse and continuous output at a 3C rate, meeting the instantaneous power requirements of the airship under complex working conditions. At the same time, it adopts a double-layer module structure and a dual-pack parallel redundancy design to ensure safe operation even if a single pack fails.
