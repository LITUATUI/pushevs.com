The RZâ€™s battery electric system has undergone complete revision, with a focus on raising the quality of both practicality and driving pleasure.

Key changes include the introduction of a new eAxle with improved motor output and inverter efficiency and a significant reduction in losses. There is also a new lithium-ion battery with capacity increased to 77.0 kWh.
