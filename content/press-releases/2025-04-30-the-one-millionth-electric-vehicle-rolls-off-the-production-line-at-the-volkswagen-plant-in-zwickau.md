In 2024, 204,000 vehicles were produced in Zwickau. Since Volkswagen took over the site in 1990, more than seven million vehicles have left the factory halls. With the start of production of electric vehicles, Zwickau took on a key role in the Volkswagen Group: For the first time, a large car factory was completely converted to electric mobility at a cost of 1.2 billion euros. The bodies for the Bentley Bentayga and the Lamborghini Urus are also manufactured in Zwickau.
