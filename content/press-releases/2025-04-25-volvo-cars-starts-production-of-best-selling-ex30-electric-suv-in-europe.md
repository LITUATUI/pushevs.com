To make EX30 production possible in Ghent, the company made investments worth around EUR 200 million in its Belgian facility in recent years. Wide-ranging changes to the plant include the addition of a completely new car platform, the installation of almost 600 new or refurbished robots, an extension of the battery hall, a new door production line as well as a new battery pack assembly line.
