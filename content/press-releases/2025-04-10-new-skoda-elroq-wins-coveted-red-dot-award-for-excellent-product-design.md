A key feature of the new Modern Solid design language that defines the front of the Elroq is the high-gloss black Tech-Deck Face, which replaces the classic radiator grille. It is topped by a Škoda wordmark on the sculpted bonnet, finished in Unique Dark Chrome – another element of the new design language. The narrow headlights with their minimalist, functional design reinterpret the typical four-eyed look of the Škoda SUV models. Depending on the trim level, a new Light Band establishes a visual link between the main headlights, which are equipped with LED technology as standard.
