With an energy density of 315 Wh/kg, the 6.3Ah SiCore™ cell builds on Amprius’ proven technology, delivering over 25% more capacity than a standard 5.0Ah 21700 cell while maintaining a high-power 3C discharge rate. It achieves 800 cycles at 80% depth of discharge (DOD), extending battery lifespan and lowering replacement costs. Designed for seamless integration, its drop-in compatibility allows manufacturers to boost performance without the need for costly system redesigns.
