Demonstrating its versatility, Renault 4 E-Tech electric combines exceptional boot space with a modular layout that is new to this segment. It includes 420 cubic litres of space, a low load sill, ingenious storage compartments, a folding rear bench seat and a flat-folding passenger seat â€“ a first for a Renault electric vehicle! Everything you need for any purpose! At the same time, the increased ground clearance and advanced Extended Grip traction control system ensure a comfortable ride, both on tarmac and on bumpy tracks. All these features, along with the record-beating interior space, low centre of gravity, roadholding, One Pedal function and range of up to 400 km, were made possible by the dedicated AmpR Small platform, the only one of its kind in Europe. Shared with Renault 5 E-Tech electric, this platform delivers significant economies of scale, with no trade-offs for customers. Renault 4 E-Tech electric is the compact car you need to stay cool in traffic jams and on long journeys.
