Scenic E-Tech electric now comes as standard with an 11 kW AC two-way charger, which can handle any power rating from 3 kW (single-phase) to 11 kW (three-phase). A new 22 kW AC bidirectional fast charger – enabling an 80 km top-up in 30 minutes at public stands – will be available as an option by summer 2025.
