Volkswagen has reached a new efficiency milestone on a circuit in Nardò, southern Italy: an ID.7 Pro S with a standard technology package and 210 kW (286 PS) covered a distance of 941 kilometres on just one battery charge (86 kWh net).

This significantly exceeded the model’s maximum WLTP range (combined) of up to 709 kilometres by 232 kilometres or 32.7 percent. During the 941-kilometre tour, the ID.7 Pro S had an average consumption of just 9.2 kWh/100 km – an exceptionally low figure. Converted to a diesel equivalent, the average consumption achieved in Nardò corresponds to about just 1 litre per 100 km. The aim of the test in Nardò was to determine the maximum efficiency of the ID.7 Pro S introduced in 2024.
