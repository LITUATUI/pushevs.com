A new electric powertrain supercharges the Puma driving experience and delivers exceptional efficiency of 13.1 kWh/100 km. Puma Gen-E offers up to 376 km on a full charge so that long journeys are well within reach, while up to 523 km of city range 2 means days of charge-free urban trips.

Connected to a fast charger, a 10-80 per cent charge takes approximately 23 minutes, while seamless acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 8.0 seconds and quicker steering response delivers the essence of Puma ST in electric form.
