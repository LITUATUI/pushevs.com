SVOLT develops Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) for various applications, such as energy buffering in solar or wind power installations where load peaks can occur. Additionally, SVOLT ESS are used wherever dynamic capacity expansion is required, such as charging stations for electric vehicles or energy supply in remote areas. SVOLT thus targets energy providers, industrial and commercial customers, as well as households. Besides developing its own ESS solutions, SVOLT also supplies third-party providers with highly innovative and efficient battery cells for their storage solutions.
