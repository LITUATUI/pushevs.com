The new Combo generation is the ideal family vehicle. Customers can once again choose from two vehicle lengths: the 4.41-metre version with space for up to five people, while the 4.76-metre version (Combo XL) can optionally accommodate up to seven passengers in three rows. If desired, the Combo Electric offers additional flexibility with three individual seats in the second row. Depending on the seating configuration the Combo XL offers up to 4,000 litres (up to the roof and with front passenger seat folded down) of load volume. Features such as the separately opening window in the tailgate make it easier to access the cargo area. 27 storage options in the cabin as well as the optionally available panorama roof with versatile overhead storage offer up to 186 litres of space for everyday items.
