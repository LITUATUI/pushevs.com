The all-new LEAF sits on Nissanâ€™s modular CMF-EV platform (which debuted with the Ariya). Efficient energy management, streamlined packaging and enhanced driving performance from Nissan's new 3-in-1 EV powertrain, are expected to help deliver significant range improvements over the previous generation. Further details will be shared mid-year.
