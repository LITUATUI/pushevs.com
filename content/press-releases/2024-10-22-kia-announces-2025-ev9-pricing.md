Kia America has announced pricing for the award-winning all-electric 2025 Kia EV9 three-row EV SUV, with only the Light Long Range trim seeing a modest increase of just $700. Pricing for all other trims remains a carryover from 2024.  The EV9 is the recipient of numerous prestigious accolades since it launched last year including the 2024 North American Utility Vehicle of the Year, World Car of the Year & World Electric Vehicle, Car and Driver 10 Best, Kelly Blue Book Best 3-Row Electric Vehicle and Motor Week Best EV.  

The all-electric three-row SUV enters its second model year with minor color and trim changes.
