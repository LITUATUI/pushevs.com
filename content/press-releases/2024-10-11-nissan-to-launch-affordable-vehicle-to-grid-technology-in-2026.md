Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology enables EV owners to use electricity stored in their carâ€™s battery to power their homes or sell it back into the grid.
EVs equipped with V2G technology can play a crucial role in integrating and increasing the mix of renewables into the energy supply by storing electricity generated by wind or solar and directing it into the grid when needed, reducing dependency on fossil fuels.
