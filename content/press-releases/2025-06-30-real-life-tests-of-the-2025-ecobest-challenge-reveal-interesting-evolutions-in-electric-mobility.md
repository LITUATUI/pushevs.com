The absolute highlight is the excellent performance of DACIA Spring, which boasts a stunning 8.17 km/kwh, an all-time record for our proprietary index EcoC 2. It was closely followed by Leapmotor T03 with 8.06 km/ kWh. Another tested model managed to cover more than 7 km/kWh. 

Three cars above 7 km/kWh, this is another first. Just two years ago, we were reporting the fact that six cars out of 14 could cover more than 6 km/kWh, now it has become the norm: in 2025 only two out of 15 do not get there!
