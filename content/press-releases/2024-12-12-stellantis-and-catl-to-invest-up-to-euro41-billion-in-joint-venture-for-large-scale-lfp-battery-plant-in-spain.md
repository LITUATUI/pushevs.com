Stellantis is employing a dual-chemistry approach – lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) – to serve all customers and exploring innovative battery cell and pack technologies. Stellantis is on track to becoming a carbon net zero corporation by 2038, all scopes included, with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.
