Sophisticated HV battery thermal management and the 800-volt electrical system make for impressive charging performance. For example, the Audi Q6 Sportback e-tron performance needs only ten minutes at a fast-charging station to charge a range of up to 265 kilometers at a maximum charging power of 270 kW under ideal conditions. It only takes the high-voltage battery 22 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent. The S model also charges at up to 270 kW, while the rear-wheel variants charge at a fast-charging station at up to 260 kW (with the 100-kWh battery) or 225 kW (with the 83-kWh battery).
