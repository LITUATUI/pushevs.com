Under the contracts, LG Energy Solution is forecasted to supply a total of 109 GWh of batteries to Ford for its electric commercial vans, starting in 2026 with contract duration ranging from four to six years.

The two companies also agreed that batteries for the current Ford Mustang Mach-E will be produced at LG Energy Solution’s Michigan facility in 2025, instead of Poland, to enhance business efficiency and capitalize on competitive market conditions, such as the IRA tax credits.
