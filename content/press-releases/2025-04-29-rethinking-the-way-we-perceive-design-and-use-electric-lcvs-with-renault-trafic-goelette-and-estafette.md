For business users working primarily in urban areas, the standard range battery uses LFP (lithium Iron phosphate) technology, free of rare metals such as cobalt and nickel for a competitive offer in terms of price and autonomy, with nearly 350 km WLTP (on Trafic), which meets the needs of many professionals.

Alongside their comfortable and versatile range, the batteries also gain the new 800V fast-charging technology, making everyday organisation easier for business users. A first for Renault vehicles!
