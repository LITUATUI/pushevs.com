The T03 is equipped with an electric powertrain which was developed by Leapmotor entirely on its own. The heart of the system is a 37.3 kWh battery which offers 265 km of range in the WLTP Combined cycle and up to 395 km range in Urban Cycle. This system is managed by an Intelligent Battery Management System (BMS) which utilizes cloud technology to monitor the state of the battery in real-time and to guarantee that it always operates within an optimal temperature range. Specifically, the electric motor develops a maximum power of 70 kW (95 CV) and a maximum torque of 158 Nm, which makes it incredibly efficient for everyday driving.
