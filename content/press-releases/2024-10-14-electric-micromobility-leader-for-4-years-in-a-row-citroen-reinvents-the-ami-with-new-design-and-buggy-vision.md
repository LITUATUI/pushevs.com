Citroën's Ami celebrates its 4th birthday this year. The Ami was a surprise at its launch in 2020, provoking astonishment and curiosity. It has become a genuine social phenomenon, attracting more than 65,000 customers and shaking up the urban and – above all – suburban automotive landscapes. The Ami has reinvented the world of quadricycles by making a flexible electric mobility solution accessible – in the form of a quirky object with innovative architecture, where symmetry plays an essential role in the design.
