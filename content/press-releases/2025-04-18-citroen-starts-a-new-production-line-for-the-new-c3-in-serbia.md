The operation of this assembly line in Serbia confirms Citroën's ambition to produce affordable electric models in the heart of Europe and testifies to the good commercial start of the New C3. In the first quarter, it took second place in electric car sales in France and third place in total sales on the French and Italian markets. In total, more than 130,000 orders have already been taken since the launch, 30% of which are for electric versions.
