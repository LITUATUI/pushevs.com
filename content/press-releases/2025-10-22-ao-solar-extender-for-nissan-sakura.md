The roof-mounted Ao-Solar Extender can charge the vehicle both while driving and when parked. The fixed roof-mounted panel can capture solar energy even when the vehicle is in motion. When stationary, an additional panel extends outward from storage, increasing the solar panel surface area and power generation potential to approximately 500 Watts. The expanded panel also creates shade and helps block sunlight from entering through the windshield, reducing cabin temperature and lowering the need for air conditioning power consumption. The system has been designed to minimize drag and integrate with the Sakura’s overall appearance.
