The Urban Cruiser will be available with two battery pack options, both of which use durable but cost-efficient lithium-iron phosphate technology. A 49-kWh battery with an output of 106 kW / 144 DIN hp will be offered exclusively with front-wheel drive while a 61-kWh battery will be available in both front and all-wheel drive Urban Cruiser versions.

In FWD format the 61-kWh battery will produce 128 kW / 174 DIN hp; in the AWD model, the power is slightly greater at 135 kW / 184 DIN hp.
