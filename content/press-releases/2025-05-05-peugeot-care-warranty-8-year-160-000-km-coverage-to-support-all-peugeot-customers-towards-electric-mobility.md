At the beginning of 2024, PEUGEOT became the first European manufacturer to offer coverage of up to 8 years/160,000 km on its 100% electric models. This programme demonstrated PEUGEOT's confidence in the quality and reliability of its 100% electric vehicles, as well as the brand's determination to encourage its customers to transition to more sustainable mobility.
