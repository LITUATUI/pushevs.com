Furthermore, CATL has successfully applied its 4C ultra-fast charging technology in the Freevoy, achieving over 280 kilometers of range on 10 minutes of charging. 

Lithium ion transport is made effortless through the application of cathode fast ion conductor coating technology, second-generation fast -charging graphite and novel nano-coating technologies for the anode, multi-gradient layered electrode design, and a brand-new ultra-high conductivity electrolyte formulation, allowing hybrids to deliver the ultimate charging experience equal to pure electric vehicles.
