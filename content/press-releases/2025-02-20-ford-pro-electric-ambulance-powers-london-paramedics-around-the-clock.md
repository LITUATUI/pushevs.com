London Ambulance Serviceâ€™s strategy of adopting electric vehicles in front-line roles is part of its Carbon Neutral Plan, which targets net zero direct emissions by 2040.

The Service also says its Ford E-Transit electric ambulances have delivered a fuel cost saving of almost 75 per cent when compared with diesel-powered equivalents.
