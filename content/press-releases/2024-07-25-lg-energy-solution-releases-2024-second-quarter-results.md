The company signed off its first large-scale (39GWh) supply agreement for LFP batteries with Renault Groupâ€™s Ampere, a meaningful achievement in the LFP segment that is currently dominated by Chinese battery manufacturers. LG Energy Solution also reaffirmed its technological leadership through this agreement, as it became first in the world to apply cell-to-pack (CTP) technology to a pouch form factor.
