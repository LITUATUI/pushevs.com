The T03 and C10 models embody Leapmotor’s vision for innovative, sustainable, and accessible mobility. The T03, a compact five-door A-segment city car, offers a range of 265 km (WLTP) and interior space comparable to a B-segment vehicle’s, making it an ideal choice for driving in the city. C10 is the D-segment SUV that combines safety, efficiency, and an intelligent driving experience with a range of 420 km (WLTP), based on the LEAP 3.0 architecture.
