Built on Kia’s dedicated 400V Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), both Kia EV4 variants benefit from a choice of standard (58.3 kWh) or long-range (81.4 kWh) battery configurations.

These supply a front-mounted 150 kW motor delivering 0-100 km/h performance of 7.4 and 7.7 seconds respectively, and a top speed of 170 km/h for both variants.
