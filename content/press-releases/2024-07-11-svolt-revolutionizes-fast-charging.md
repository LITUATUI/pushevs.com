This innovative energy storage solution can charge from 10% to 80% in just ten minutes and has a lifespan of 3,500 charge cycles. For comparison, high-performance lithium-ion batteries are designed for at least 1,000 full charge cycles, equating to a minimum of 300,000 km for a 60 kWh battery with a 20 kWh per 100 km con-sumption. These features, along with an energy density of 188 Wh/kg, mark significant pro-gress in battery technology and represent a crucial development for the electric mobility industry.
