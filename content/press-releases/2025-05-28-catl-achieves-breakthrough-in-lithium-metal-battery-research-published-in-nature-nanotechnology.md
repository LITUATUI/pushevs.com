The resulting LMB prototype, while exhibiting the same CE as the previous iteration, doubles the cycle life to 483 cycles, and can be adopted in new designs with an energy density over 500 Wh/kg. This breakthrough initiates a paradigm shift for developing batteries that are both energy-dense and built to last.
