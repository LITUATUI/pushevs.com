And the Grandland Electric will also be available with a 157 kW (213 hp) electric motor, 345 Nm of torque, 73 kWh battery (net capacity) and a locally emissions-free range of up to 523 kilometres (WLTP1) from €46,750. Furthermore, the battery-electric SUV will be offered with 82 kWh battery (net capacity) and a locally emissions-free range of up to 582 kilometres (WLTP1) in the extensively equipped GS trim for prices starting at €51,950. But that is not all. The new Grandland is the first Opel based on the BEV-native STLA Medium platform. With the 97 kWh battery, which will be available soon, the Grandland Electric will be able to cover up to around 700 kilometres (WLTP1) between charging stops. One thing all Grandland variants have in common: They all offer numerous innovative technologies, clever features and sustainable solutions along with a stunning appearance thanks to the new 3D Vizor – which even comes with illuminated Blitz emblem in the GS trim.
