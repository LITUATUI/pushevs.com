The ideally sized LFP battery (up to 263 km WLTP range) is combined with a lively, lightweight 60 kW motor. Twingo E-Tech electric is perfect for driving in and around cities, where the One Pedal function makes light work of day-to-day traffic jams. Finally, competitive pricing remains a priority: Twingo E-Tech electric will launch at under €20,000. Even the top-spec versions will sell for an attractive price.
