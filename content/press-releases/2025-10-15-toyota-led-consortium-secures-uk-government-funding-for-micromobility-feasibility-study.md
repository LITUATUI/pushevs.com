Drawing inspiration from the FT-Me concept, unveiled in March 2025 as Toyota’s vision for future micromobility in Europe, the study builds on the positive public response to the concept’s design and purpose. The study also aims to explore and validate how Toyota’s vision can be translated into a viable proposition that is aligned with the company’s environmental and mobility goals.
