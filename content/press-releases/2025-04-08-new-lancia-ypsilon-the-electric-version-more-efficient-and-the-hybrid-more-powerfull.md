With a 54-kilowatt-hour battery and a 115-kilowatt electric engine offering 156 hp, the New Ypsilon Electric allows one to cover up to 425 km with a single charge—an increase of around 6%, or 22 km more than the previous model. This improvement comes courtesy of a nickel-manganese-cobalt battery with enhanced chemistry and an even more efficient powertrain. Average consumption now comes in at 14.3 kilowatt-hour every 100 km, making Lancia’s new compact car even more sustainable and easier to manage without an increase in its cost. 

Furthermore, when the car needs to be charged, it reaches 80% in less than 30 minutes in a 100-kW charging station with direct current. In short, with this new upgrade, Lancia has proven once again its commitment to making electric mobility even easier and more worthwhile.
