The Kia EV3 has been awarded the highest possible rating of “Very Good” in the assisted driving test of Europe’s independent vehicle safety authority, Euro NCAP. The test evaluated the model’s Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA 2), a system that combines real-time driver monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and lane centring.
