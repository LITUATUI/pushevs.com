European drivers need performance that adapts to changing conditions. With a long-range 81.4-kWh battery pack, the EV5 offers up to 530 kilometres of all-electric range (AER) (WLTP estimated). Both the base car and the GT-Line variant support fast charging, from 10 to 80 per cent in as little as 30 minutes.
