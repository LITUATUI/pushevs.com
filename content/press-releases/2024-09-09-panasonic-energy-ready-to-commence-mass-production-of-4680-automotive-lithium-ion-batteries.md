The 4680, a revolutionary cell format of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), offers substantial improvements over the conventional 2170 cells. These new cells possess five times the capacity of the 2170 cell. This not only extends the driving range of EVs, but also reduces the number of cells required for the same battery pack capacity. This results in a more efficient battery pack assembly process and ultimately lowers the cost of EVs, making them more affordable to a wider market.
