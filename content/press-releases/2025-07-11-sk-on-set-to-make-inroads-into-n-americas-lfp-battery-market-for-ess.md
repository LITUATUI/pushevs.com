SK On has been actively developing LFP batteries as part of its battery chemistry diversification strategy.

The company unveiled its first LFP battery prototype at InterBattery 2023, followed by the introduction of the ‘Winter Pro Battery’—designed for improved low-temperature performance—in 2024, and a long-life LFP battery in 2025.
