Thanks to its new efficiency drive and excellent aerodynamics (drag coefficient of 0.23 depending on equipment), the ID.7 Pro S is economical on the road. Depending on optional equipment, a combined WLTP consumption of 16.2 to 13.6 kWh/100 km was determined for the ID.7 Pro S. With the most range-favourable equipment, the WLTP range is up to 709 km. The charging times are short: In 10 minutes – the time needed for a coffee break – energy for approx. 244 km flows into the battery at 200 kW charging power; in about 26 minutes it is charged again from 10 to 80 percent.
