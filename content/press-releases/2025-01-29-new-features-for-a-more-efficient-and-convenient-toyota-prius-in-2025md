With its dual DNA of true electric vehicle driving and the convenience of hybrid, the latest Prius achieves a driving range of up to 86 km (WLTP combined) of near-silent electric driving with no tailpipe emissions, enough for full electric driving on most daily journeys.

When driven exclusively on city or urban roads, Priusâ€™ equivalent all-electric range increases to 110 km.
