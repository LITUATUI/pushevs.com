The goal of the joint battery cell program is to provide more affordable, next-generation EV batteries with best-in-class technologies to Stellantis and its joint venture gigafactories.

The battery cell design program reinforces a 20-year dynamic collaboration with CEA. Other areas of joint research include disruptive chemistries and CO2 footprint research, battery modeling, fuel cell development, life cycle assessment and connectivity.
