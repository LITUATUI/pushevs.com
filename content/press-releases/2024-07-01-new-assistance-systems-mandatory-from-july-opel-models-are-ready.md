In addition to the systems that have long been required by law, new cars registered from July onwards must also have additional assistants on board. These include emergency braking assistant, intelligent speed assistant, lane departure warning system, reversing assistant and drowsiness detection. An emergency brake light and a “black box” data recorder are also among the mandatory features in the future.
