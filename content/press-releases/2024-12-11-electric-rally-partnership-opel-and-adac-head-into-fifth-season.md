Ever since the 2021 season, the ADAC Opel Electric Rally Cup “powered by GSe” has been proving that electric rally sport is not only dynamic and fascinating, but also sustainable and divers. When the participants face each other in the world's first electric rally one-make cup in their near-production, 100 kW (136 hp) Opel Corsa Rally Electric, exciting competitions are guaranteed. A recipe for success that is now entering the next round. Because Opel and the ADAC are sending a clear signal and hosting the ADAC Opel Electric Rally Cup for the fifth time in 2025.
