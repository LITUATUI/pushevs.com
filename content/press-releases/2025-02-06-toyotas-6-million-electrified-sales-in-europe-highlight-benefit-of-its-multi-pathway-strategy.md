Toyota Motor Europe (TME) has reached a significant milestone with its cumulative sales of electrified vehicles surpassing six million at the end of 2024.

This achievement reflects the success of Toyota’s multi-pathway strategy which enables customers to reduce emissions wherever they live, especially where the enabling conditions for zero emission vehicles are limited.
