The all-electric Zafira Electric is even better than before in terms of efficiency and range. It is available with either a 50 kWh or a 75 kWh battery. With the further developed 75 kWh battery on board, a range of up to 347 kilometres (WLTP1) is possible without stopping to charge â€“ over 20 kilometres more than before.
