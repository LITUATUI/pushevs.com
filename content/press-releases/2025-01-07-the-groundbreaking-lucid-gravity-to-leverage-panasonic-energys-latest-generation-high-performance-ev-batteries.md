These impressive features are enabled in part by Panasonic Energy's latest-generation high performing 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells, which offer an energy density of above 800Wh/L (watt-hours per liter), an industry-leading achievement.

These high-capacity cells were realized through a closer working relationship with Lucid and are designed to specifically meet Lucidâ€™s exceptional standards for fast-charging, safety, longevity and performance.

Lucid Gravity will be one of the first vehicles to leverage this next-generation cell at scale.
