Dacia Spring finally got a generous, but predictable price cut in an European country. Belgium is the first to get it, but other European countries will soon follow.

These are the prices of the different variants in Belgium.

- ESSENTIAL: 10.590 euros
- EXPRESSION: 12.290 euros
- EXTREME: 14.290 euros

These prices already include VAT, and no, there is no governmental subsidy involved. This means that in Belgium, you can get the fully equipped Dacia Spring with the DC charging (500 euros) and front sensors (150 euros) options for 14.940 euros.

This price cut is required for Dacia to increase the sales of the only electric car in its fleet and comply with CO2 emission targets set in the [EU regulation](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/transport/road-transport-reducing-co2-emissions-vehicles/co2-emission-performance-standards-cars-and-vans_en) for 2025.

However, this price cut might not be enough.

The [Leapmotor T03](/2024/10/08/leapmotor-t03-makes-the-dacia-spring-obsolete/) is already available to order and the amazing BYD Seagull will arrive next year... Both with long-lasting and robust LFP batteries, while the Dacia Spring is powered by NCM batteries - that have lower cycle life.

Current Dacia Spring is based on the old Chinese Dongfeng Nano Box, the next generation will probably be based on the much better Dongfeng Nammi Box, which already has a long-lasting 42,3 kWh LFP battery, 340 km of WLTP range, 70 kW motor and looks super cool (new smart vibes). 

Curiously, the Dongfeng Nammi Box is already being sold in [Switzerland for 21.990 CHF (23.367 euros)](https://www.dongfeng-nammi-box.ch/en) and [Czechia](https://dfmotor.cz/box/#technickeparametre).

What do you think? Can the Dacia Spring survive with its current generation and a generous price cut, or it really needs a new generation based on the Dongfeng Nammi Box?
