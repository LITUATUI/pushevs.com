The ZEEKR 009 electric MPV, part of Geely’s innovative EV lineup, now features CATL’s cutting-edge Qilin battery technology, enabling it to recharge from 10% to 80% in just under 11 minutes. This updated model is set to launch in Hong Kong this Friday.

The ZEEKR’s super-fast charging ability is enabled by CATL’s Qilin battery technology, which integrates advanced chemistry, form factor, cooling, and intelligent battery management to improve performance. The next time someone tells you that EVs take hours to refill, you can counter with the ZEEKR 009 and its 11-minute refill capability.

Unveiled in June 2022, CATL’s Qilin technology supports both LFP and NCM cell chemistries. The refreshed ZEEKR 009 uses NCM cells to achieve high energy density, superior thermal control, and rapid DC charging speeds. The vehicle employs an 800-volt system design, although Qilin technology itself is system voltage-agnostic.

When [Qilin technology was announced by CATL in June 2022](https://www.catl.com/en/news/958.html), the company informed us that the initial _pack-level_ energy density (using NMC cells) was 255 Wh/kg. They also mentioned 4C charging rates (15 minutes to fully refill the battery from empty).  These performance characteristics may have further evolved in the two years that have passed.

ZEEKR is officially claiming “11 minutes” to recharge the new 009 model from 10% to 80%, although images they released showed a slightly faster example — 10 minutes and 46 seconds:

The peak charging rate required to get the job done this quickly is 561.9 kW, much faster than almost any DC chargers currently available outside a few select locations in China, which is the world’s largest EV market. Even as the battery passes 80% state of charge, the vehicle is still pulling in 294.3 kW (see above image).

While 350 kW chargers are now fairly common in China, East Asia, Europe, and North America, allowing the ZEEKR 009 to recharge from 10% to 80% in approximately 16-17 minutes under optimal conditions, more powerful 450 kW and [600 kW chargers](https://chargefinder.com/en/charging-station-lier-sparki-lier/enj76z) can further reduce this time to 13 and 11 minutes, respectively. However, these higher-power chargers are still relatively rare.

The launch version of the refreshed ZEEKR 009 comes with a large 140 kWh battery pack, a capacity which is enabled (while keeping weight and volume manageable) by the very high energy density of the battery pack, thanks to Qilin.

The ZEEKR 009 is a large MPV format vehicle, with a length of 5,217 mm, and height of 1,812 mm. The first generation 009 launched in 2022, and was offered in 4-seat versions as well as 6-seat versions. Priced from 500,000 RMB (€63,300 or $68,850), it has been a decent seller, averaging over 1,500 units per month in 2023.

The refreshed 2024 ZEEKR 009 will launch in Hong Kong on Friday the 19th of July, and will initially be offered in a high-end variant with a 140 kWh battery. This is the variant which allows for the 11-minute fast charging, noted above, and offers a range of 822 km on the CLTC cycle. The CLTC cycle is tuned for the modest speed urban driving pattern most common in China, whereas its WLTP rating (still pending) might be on the order of 700 km (or 435 miles).

The price of the 140 kWh launch variant has not yet been announced, though we can expect it to be in line with high end variants of the previous generation, at around 789,000 RMB (€99,860 or $108,650). Other variants with smaller batteries and lower prices will eventually be offered also.

The 009 will be offered in 4-seat and 6-seat options, and additionally — new with the 2024 update — now also in 7-seat options.

EV battery technology is still developing very fast. For most people with daily or weekly access to a convenient plug, the existing DC recharge speeds of typically 25 to 35 minutes are already a comfortable fit. These charging capabilities are already well suited to taking a much needed break after two or three hours of driving on a long journey — one of the few times DC charging is needed.

For die-hard petrol-heads who complain that EV recharging is “not as fast as fossil fuel refilling” (ignoring that most charge is done without any “delay” at home), the 11-minute charging of the ZEEKR 009 might just give them pause for thought.

And EV battery technology is not stopping here. CATL has already invented an EV battery with a 10C charging rate, which allows 10% to 80% charging in 5 minutes (not yet commercialized). This will enable drivers without access to a daily plug to nevertheless “top up” one or twice a week at a charging hub, with the same convenience that ICE drivers now top up with gasoline. As EV battery technology continues to evolve, that diversionary old argument that “EVs take too long to charge” will soon become obsolete.
